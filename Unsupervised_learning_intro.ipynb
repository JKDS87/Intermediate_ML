    "- Visualization: if there is high-dimensional data that would be impossible to visualize, sometimes by transforming that data to lower-dimensional space, it is possible to visualize things like clusters.\n",
    "- Model Speed: using PCA prior to modeling can reduce the dimensions of the data, allowing the modeling to run faster.\n",
    "- Clustering: by using PC's for clustering models, many features can be used indirectly by replacing the original number of features with fewer features."
