    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "- The process of reducing the number of features used in modeling. This can improve model performance, speed up the model, and address the 'curse of dimensionality'\n",

    "- Filter methods\n",
    "    - Relies on features' charcteristics, with the selection process not relying on machine learning models.\n",
    "    - Ideal for quick screening and removing irrelevant or poorly performing features.\n",
    "    - Pros: model agnostic, less computationally expensive than other models.\n",
    "    - Cons: lower improvement in model performance vs other models.\n",
    "- Embedded methods\n",
    "    - Will perform feature selection as part of the modeling/training process.\n",
    "    - Pros: Consider the interactions between features and models. Less computationally expensive than Wrapper methods (only fit 1 time vs many times)\n",
    "    - Cons: Features can only be selected with certain models. Selected features may not always be appropriate for different model types.\n",
    "- Wrapper methods\n",
    "    - Use predictive machine learning models to score various subsets of features.\n",
    "    - A new model is trained and tested for each feature subset to obtain the highest-performing list of features.\n",
    "    - Pros: Provides the best-performing subset for a given model type\n",
    "    - Cons: Very computationally expensive\n",
    "    - May not produce the best feature ccombos for different methods"
